# State/region pages

A short marketing page will be produced for each state/region. They'll be visible from the main GovHack website at govhack.org/nsw, govhack.org/qld, et cetera.

Contact your region's **Digital Producer** to make changes to your marketing page:

For NSW, QLD, ACT, and NZ: [alan@govhack.org](mailto:alan@govhack.org?Subject=GovHack%20Marketing%20Page%20Update)

For WA, SA, VIC, and TAS: [jun@govhack.org](mailto:jun@govhack.org?Subject=GovHack%20Marketing%20Page%20Update)


# Individual event pages

This year we are introducing a Competition Portal ([portal.govhack.org](http://portal.govhack.org)) which will centralise all the competition information that competitors need to know (a one-stop shop!).

Each event will have it's own page within the portal - where local event teams will provide detailed information about their events.

## Updating event pages

We are currently developing a set of forms for you to use to have changes made to your part of the competition portal. Stay tuned. 

In the meantime, if it's imperative to add a new location or make updates, you can contact your region's digital producer (see above).


# Your existing websites or digital assets

Some states/regions/events have purchased their own domains, or have their own websites etc. That's great! Let us know so that we can appropriately link to you from the main GovHack website.

But remember, we'll still need you to list all of the key information about your event (where it is, prizes, datasets, mentors, et cetera) on the main GovHack website and the competition portal.


# Further updates on the way

We have a number of exciting new initiatives we hope to release in the next few weeks, including a better-than-ever participant toolkit Stay tuned!
