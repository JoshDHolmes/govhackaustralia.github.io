# Intro for Hosts and Managers
Welcome to the guide for GovHack Event Hosts and Managers on how GovHack's online presence will be structured in 2016.

There are two major changes taking place this year:

1. **Revamping our main website at govhack.org** with a simpler, cleaner, more modern design, and rewriting and restructing its content to be more accessible to a wider audience.

2. **Launching a new website focused on the competition at portal.govhack.org** to provide a single place for competitors (and everyone else) one place to find all of the information they need to know (a one-stop shop!) - from the prizes on offer, the available datasets, who's mentoring, and ultimately, the projects that come out of it, and the prize winners.

## What's changing?

In short, we're introducing structure where before there was very little by:

1. Storing what we already have - events, datasets, prizes, et cetera - in a defined structure in a database.
2. Trying out some new ideas we think will enhance the competition - such as adding themes and better supporting challenges/problem statements.
3. Now that everything has a defined structure, we can easily link it together to make navigating the competition easier - e.g. Look at a prize and see not only its description, but the datasets and data portals relevant to it, the mentors who are supporting it. 
4. Creating a showcase that will highlight all of the awesome projects the hackers create, celebrate the winners, and provide a permanent home for all of the stories and outcomes from GovHack.
5. A short marketing page will be created for each state/region at govhack.org. They'll be visible from govhack.org/nsw, govhack.org/qld, et cetera.

## How will we make changes?

In short, you'll be using a set of forms we're creating to provide the updates to our new Web Team, and they'll be updating it for you.

### Why can't we just publish this all ourselves like we used to?

Fair question - and we're planning for that, but this first iteration is very much an experiment and a "[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)". If everything goes well, and these new ideas work, we'll be investing time after GovHack in creating a user-friendly publishing interface with no technical knowledge required.

### Self-publishing is possible now, but there's a catch

But it requires a bit of technical knowledge and isn't as user-friendly as a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) interface from platforms like Wordpress, Squarespace, and so on. If a member of your local team is proficient in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and has used GitHub's web interface before then we're more than happy to give them access to the backend of the platform to self-publish.

Get in touch with the Web Team via Basecamp or at [web@govhack.org](mailto:web@govhack.org?Subject=Portal%20GitHub%20Access).

### Our event/state already has a website

That's great! Actually, quite a few of the ideas that make up these changes were inspired by things we've seen on GovHack websites created by local event teams. If your team has the capacity and drive to run its own web presence we're fully supportive of that, and will do what we can to help you (e.g. Supplying GovHack digital assets, and a style guide).

**But remember, we'll still need you to list all of the key information about your event (where it is, prizes, datasets, mentors, et cetera) on the main GovHack website and the competition portal.**

## Your Digital Producers
